This isn't a script file. This describes how to get the project running on a Windows machine.

1. Install python version 3 for windows.
2. Install virtualenvwrapper-win with pip on the terminal(pip install virtualenvwrapper-win)
3. While still in the terminal, make your virtual environment and install necessary software within it
	mkvirtualenv myproject
	pip install django
	pip install Pillow
	
4. Install git for windows(make sure to download the desktop version and not mobile)
5. Clone the github repository to a directory

First, navigate to a directory you wish to store your github repositories in with the terminal. 
Then type the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Ssuarez0/CS4950GroupProject.git

6. Use the "deactivate" command while in the terminal.

Boom. You now have a copy of our project on your system.

Steps to do every time working with this setup:
1. workon myproject
2. cd /path/to/project/directory
3. git pull origin master
4. Do whatever django stuff you need to.
5. When done:
	a. If you made changes, add any new files with "git add <filepath>" and commit changes with "git commit -a". 
		Then use "git push origin master".
	b. After step a, or if you simply didn't make any changes, type "deactivate"

Example image upload:

>>> print(edit_bird)
American Wigeon
>>> print(edit_bird.Diet)
Aquatic plants; some insects and mollusks during the breeding season.
>>> f=File(open('Scripts/Data/Media/Picture/American Wigeon/male.jpg', 'rb'))
>>> edit_bird.Image.save("AmericanWigeon.jpg", f)
>>> print(edit_bird.Image)
AmericanWigeon_exsSSp1.jpg

Image.save will save the bird instance, so make sure that's one of the last things you add.

Example file upload:

 f=File(open('Scripts/Data/Media/Audio/American Wigeon.mp3', 'rb'))
 edit_bird.Sound.save("AmericanWigeon.mp3", f)

To turn this into a loop:
1. Create the file path in a variable with a substitute string.
2. Create the new file name using the same strategy as number 1.
3. Create a File object using the module django.core.files.File like above.
4. Feed these variables into a call for the desired field like above.

Remember that you need to pass rb because the files need to be read in binary mode. Otherwise the script will crash.
